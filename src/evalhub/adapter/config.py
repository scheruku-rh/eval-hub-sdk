    The job spec path can be configured via the EVALHUB_JOB_SPEC_PATH
    environment variable. This allows the SDK to work in different
    environments:

    - Kubernetes (EVALHUB_MODE=k8s): /meta/job.json
    - Local testing (default): meta/job.json or any custom path
    - Job runs submitted via evalhub server in --local mode:

    Returns:
        Path: Path to the job spec JSON file

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the job spec file does not exist

    Example:
        ```python
        # Use default location (Kubernetes)
        spec_path = get_job_spec_path()  # /meta/job.json

        # Set custom location for local testing
        os.environ["EVALHUB_JOB_SPEC_PATH"] = "./meta/job.json"
